For example, this is an acceptable non-commercial analytical use of the Yelp Content. “Non-commercial use” means any use of the Yelp Content which does not generate promotional or monetary value for the creator or the user, or such use does not gain economic value from the use of our content for the creator or user, i.e. you.
